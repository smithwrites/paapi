## About

The Planning Register API is a project by [Open Digital Planning](https://opendigitalplanning.org/).

## Register vision
The Planning Register is a public resource for anyone who wants to find out about planning applications, including those in their local area.
The register will be an open data hub with a common thread of key data on applications. This will become richer over the lifecycle of an application. 

It will be easy to interact with for the most common journeys, for example:
- neighbours looking for a specific application by reference number or address
- users who want to access whole datasets based on specific factors, such as new homes in a specific area

The interface will be intuitive and framed around these common journeys. Raw data can be queried and extracted.
