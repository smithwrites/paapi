## Sources

We have two main sources of planning application data
 - through BoPS
 - historical data extracted from other back office systems, exported through BI tools

The data we can extract comes from CSV files via the BI tool. This gives us enough data for our [schema](/storing-data/schema), but does not provide spatial or document data. We need to address this in future work.

## Short term plan

For now, we will work with CSV data extracted using this method.

### Long term

We'd like other organisations to send us historical data through our [Planning Application API](/api-docs).
